# 📜 MASTER BLUEPRINT — Model Horse Hub

> **This is the Single Source of Truth for all architectural rules.**
> Every workflow and every agent session MUST read this file first.
> Last updated: 2026-04-03

**Reading order for new sessions:**
1. Read THIS file (Iron Laws + guardrails)
2. Read `MASTER_SUPABASE.md` (schema reference)
3. Read `workflows/onboard.md` (current state snapshot — metrics, file counts)
4. Read `workflows/dev-nextsteps.md` (active task queue)

## 🏛️ Project Iron Laws

These are the **non-negotiable architectural principles** that govern every database migration, server action, and UI component. They were forged during the Grand Unification (V6–V10) and hardened through 110 production migrations.

1. **Zero Data Loss Migrations** — Every schema change MUST include a robust PL/pgSQL data migration script. We move existing production data *before* we drop old tables.

2. **Exclusive Arcs** — When linking a universal table (e.g., `posts`, `media_attachments`) to specific entities (horses, groups, events), use multiple nullable Foreign Keys combined with a Postgres `CHECK (num_nonnulls(...) <= 1)` constraint to ensure strict referential integrity.

3. **Event Sourcing (Single Source of Truth)** — If data exists in a primary domain table (e.g., `show_records`, `horse_transfers`), it must **never** be manually duplicated into a UI timeline table. UI timelines must be driven by PostgreSQL `VIEWS` (e.g., `v_horse_hoofprint`).

4. **Vercel Payload Compliance** — File payloads must NEVER pass through Next.js Server Actions. Direct-to-storage via the Supabase browser client is mandatory for all media.

5. **Atomic Mutations** — Counters (likes, replies) and complex state transitions must use transactional Postgres RPCs with `FOR UPDATE` row locks (e.g., `make_offer_atomic`, `respond_to_offer_atomic`, `toggle_post_like`).

6. **RLS InitPlan Pattern** — All RLS policies MUST use `(SELECT auth.uid())` instead of bare `auth.uid()` to prevent per-row function evaluation. Every `SECURITY DEFINER` function must include `SET search_path = ''` with fully qualified `public.table_name` references. The `pg_trgm` extension lives in the `extensions` schema (not `public`).

## 🔒 Live User-Data Guardrails (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

> **75+ registered users with financial and provenance data. This section is absolute.**

### Protected Tables (require human review for ANY schema change):
- `user_horses` — model inventory (900+ rows)
- `financial_vault` — purchase prices, estimated values (PRIVATE)
- `show_records` — competition history, provenance
- `transactions` — commerce state machine (offers, payments)
- `horse_images` — storage references (private signed URLs)
- `events` / `event_entries` — competition engine
- `users` — profiles, auth, tier metadata
- `horse_ownership_history` — transfer provenance chain

### Rules:
1. Any Server Action or API route touching protected tables MUST:
   - Use atomic RPCs or Server Actions with an RLS verification comment
   - Call `requireAuth()` from `@/lib/auth` (NOT raw `getUser()`)
   - Use `logger.error()` for failures (NEVER silent `catch {}`)
   - Be wrapped in `after()` for background tasks (serverless safety)

2. Any migration touching protected tables MUST:
   - Be reviewed by human before `supabase db push`
   - Include a rollback plan or `IF NOT EXISTS` guards
   - Never let AI run `supabase db push` or `supabase migration up` directly

3. URLs must never expose raw UUIDs for public views (use `alias_name` or `slug`)

4. `financial_vault` is NEVER queried on public routes — owner-only via RLS

5. Watermark opt-in: respect `watermark_photos` boolean on users table

## 🤖 Agent Execution Protocol

Every workflow file and every new agent session MUST follow this protocol:

### Session Start:
1. Read `MASTER_BLUEPRINT.md` (this file)
2. Read `MASTER_SUPABASE.md` (schema reference)
3. Read `workflows/onboard.md` (current metrics and conventions)
4. Read `workflows/dev-nextsteps.md` (task queue)
5. Ask the human what they'd like to do

### Before Writing Code:
- Verify the change doesn't violate any Iron Law
- Check if a similar pattern already exists in the codebase
- For database changes: write the migration SQL and present for human review FIRST

### After Writing Code:
- Run `cmd /c "npx next build 2>&1"` — must be 0 errors
- Update the workflow file — mark tasks ✅ DONE with date
- Update `onboard.md` metrics if migration count or component count changed
- Update `dev-nextsteps.md` if completing a tracked task

### Workflow File Header (MANDATORY for new workflows):
Every new workflow MUST include this at the top:
> **MANDATORY:** Read `.agents/MASTER_BLUEPRINT.md` and `.agents/MASTER_SUPABASE.md` first.
> All Iron Laws and guardrails apply.
